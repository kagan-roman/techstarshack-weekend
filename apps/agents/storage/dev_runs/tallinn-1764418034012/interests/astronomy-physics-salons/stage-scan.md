Key leads and venues
- Baltic Astronomy Club (MTÜ) – community hub in Tallinn; FB page active, hints at booking public observatory nights via “Rahva Observatoorium”.
  • https://www.facebook.com/balticastronomy/
- Astronoomiafestival 2025 – national astro festival (Aug, outside trip window) but lists core organizers and speakers in the Estonian scene (contact leads).
  • https://festival.astronoomia.ee/
- Astronoomia.ee – gateway to Estonian astronomy; mentions Baltic Astronomy Club and Munalaskme/Rahva observatoorium.

- Tartu Observatoorium (Tõravere) – not in Tallinn but often lists public events and contacts who can point to Tallinn stargazing opportunities.

Preliminary takeaways
- Tallinn’s public stargazing often runs through community clubs (Baltic Astronomy Club / Rahva Observatoorium). December events are weather-dependent and announced via Facebook.
- Formal “science café/teaduskohvik” and university talks may appear on TalTech/Tallinn University calendars; require date validation for the trip window.

Hypotheses to validate next
- Are there public viewing nights near Tallinn (Munalaskme observatory or city-adjacent dark sites) scheduled between Dec 1–14, 2025?
- Any English-friendly science cafés or physics talks in Tallinn during that window?

Why some channels may be quiet
- FB groups can be closed or announce late due to weather; university calendars often publish monthly.
