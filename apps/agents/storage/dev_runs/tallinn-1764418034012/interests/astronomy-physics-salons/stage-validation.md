Stage: VALIDATION
Window: 2025-12-01 → 2025-12-14 (Tallinn)

What we tried
- ET/RU/EN queries for: Rahva Observatoorium / Munalaskme tähetorn public viewing; Baltic Astronomy Club FB page; TalTech/TLU physics colloquia; teaduskohvik Tallinn.

Results
- Baltic Astronomy Club FB page is active but event details are gated to FB and announced ad hoc (weather dependent). No static calendar surfaced in scan.
  • https://www.facebook.com/balticastronomy/
- No December 1–14 fixed observatory nights found on public websites during scan; likely short-notice announcements via FB.

Assessment for trip window
- Astronomy options: stay flexible and follow BAC FB events; message in ET/RU for potential small-group viewing. University talks may appear closer to dates; check TalTech/TLU calendars weekly.

Fallbacks
- Consider dark-sky micro-escape: quick train/car to Keila-Joa or Lahemaa if clear night; coordinate with BAC for gear.

Notes on limitations
- Estonian FB groups limit non-logged browsing; much of the scene coordinates via closed events or last-minute posts.
