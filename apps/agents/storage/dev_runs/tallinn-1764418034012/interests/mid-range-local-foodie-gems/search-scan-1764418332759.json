The Estonian capital has quietly grown into one of Europe’s most exciting dining destinations, blending traditional flavours with modern creativity and a clear love for local ingredients.\n\nFrom Michelin recognised spots in Tallinn Old Town to creative kitchens in the buzzing Telliskivi district, the city is full of memorable meals waiting to be discovered. In this guide, I’m sharing the restaurants that stood out most on our trip, from Rado’s minimalist plates to F-Hoone’s eclectic comfort food, places that prove Tallinn belongs on every foodie’s map.\n\n#### Tallinn Mini Guide\n\n**When to Visit:** Tallinn is a great **year-round destination.** Summer in Tallinn is ideal for outdoor activities and that all-around good feeling, while winter in Tallinn and Christmas bring a truly magical atmosphere. Spring and autumn are both lovely shoulder seasons, but I’d avoid late winter, when it’s often grey and icy.**[Where to Stay:](https://booking.stay22.com/mariaolivia/Ex1L01Qnp9?aid=mariaolivia&campaign=urbanandbeyondcouk-10bestthingstodointallinnestoniaforfirsttimevisitors&product=allez&habl=false&isinc=false&sid22=1df44797-9015-4dae-93a6-9a1878c24b81&plng=en-US&pageCategory=travel&lmaID=685c1655ffb45ec4a3cd1b23&address=Tallinn%2C+Estonia&source=direct)** [Bob W Ambassador (€)](https://booking.stay22.com/mariaolivia/fr4RK5zhmy?aid=mariaolivia&campaign=urbanandbeyondcouk-10bestthingstodointallinnestoniaforfirsttimevisitors&product=allez&habl=false&isinc=false&sid22=1df44797-9015-4dae-93a6-9a1878c24b81&plng=en-US&pageCategory=travel&lmaID=685c1655ffb45ec4a3cd1b23&address=Tallinn%2C+Estonia&source=direct)[Merchant’s House Hotel (€)](https://booking.stay22.com/mariaolivia/ws8b7wW8qN?aid=mariaolivia&campaign=urbanandbeyondcouk-10bestthingstodointallinnestoniaforfirsttimevisitors&product=allez&habl=false&isinc=false&sid22=1df44797-9015-4dae-93a6-9a1878c24b81&plng=en-US&pageCategory=travel&lmaID=685c1655ffb45ec4a3cd1b23&address=Tallinn%2C+Estonia&source=direct)[Nordic Hotel Forum (€€)](https://booking.stay22.com/mariaolivia/J0bBCf8hZA?aid=mariaolivia&campaign=urbanandbeyondcouk-10bestthingstodointallinnestoniaforfirsttimevisitors&product=allez&habl=false&isinc=false&sid22=1df44797-9015-4dae-93a6-9a1878c24b81&plng=en-US&pageCategory=travel&lmaID=685c1655ffb45ec4a3cd1b23&address=Tallinn%2C+Estonia&source=direct)**How to Get There:**Tallinn International Airport is well-connected, with flights arriving from most major European cities. If you’re travelling from nearby Baltic capitals like Riga or Vilnius, you can reach Tallinn by plane, bus, or train.**Getting Around:**Tallinn is a compact city, which makes it incredibly easy to explore on foot. The public transport system is also excellent, with frequent buses and trams running throughout the city. And for something a bit more fun, my favourite way to get around is by Lime e-scooter!**Photo Spots:**The Kohtuotsa Viewing Platform, Town Hall Square, and Patkuli Viewing Platform!\n\n### Rado: Modern Simplicity in Tallinn’s Old Town\n\nWhile it’s easy to find “touristy” restaurants in a city’s old town, often relying on foot traffic rather than flavour, Rado breaks the mould entirely. Tucked into Tallinn’s medieval centre, it brings a fresh, thoughtful approach to dining that feels anything but expected.\n\nRado first opened in 2019, founded by Rado and Triinu, former owners of Ribe, which once occupied the same address. Together, they’ve created something special; a space that combines minimalism without pretense, simplicity with serious flavour, and a focus on local ingredients without overexplaining it. It’s no surprise it’s been recognised by the Michelin Guide.\n\nThe interior has a bright, welcoming atmosphere, while the downstairs space offers a more intimate setting ideal for evening meals. It’s refined but relaxed, the kind of place where you can lean into a long dinner without ever feeling rushed. We chose to sit outside on a breezy late summer day, and it felt completely peaceful.\n\nThe menu is small and ever-changing, shaped by what’s fresh at the local market each morning. That approach gives each dish room to shine, and the kitchen clearly treats every ingredient with care. Expect an inventive mix of Estonian and Slavic flavours, all presented with a modern, unfussy elegance.\n\nStandouts for us included the delicate fish carpaccio with chicory and their signature roasted cauliflower with Parmesan, both simple ideas, but beautifully executed. We ended the meal with a rich and creamy Basque cheesecake, paired perfectly with a tart berry compote.\n\nIt was the kind of meal that lingers, and we still talk about Rado, long after leaving Tallinn.\n\n### F-Hoone: A Creative City Staple Worth the Hype\n\nLocated in the heart of Telliskivi Creative City, F-Hoone was the first restaurant we visited in Tallinn, and it made an unforgettable first impression.\n\nFrom the outside, it looks like an old industrial building, blending right into Telliskivi’s creative and repurposed vibe. But step inside, and you’re met with a bright, spacious interior that feels part community hub, part restaurant. It’s buzzy, warm, and full of life. F-Hoone is something of a local institution, and we loved it so much that we returned for one last meal before leaving Tallinn.\n\nThe menu is as eclectic as the space, a mix of Estonian comfort dishes and globally inspired plates. From traditional meat dumplings to Thai Tom Kha soup, F-Hoone manages to pull off a surprising range of flavours without missing a beat. That kind of diversity on a menu often backfires, but here, it just works.\n\nEverything we tried was the perfect mix of exciting and comforting, but the dish that pulled us back in was the Crispy Chicken; a soul food-style plate of chicken and waffles, served with red cabbage slaw, curry pickles, and mango-curry mayo. The chicken was juicy and flavour-packed, the waffle crisp and golden under a drizzle of maple syrup. Honestly, it might be the best chicken and waffles I’ve ever had.\n\n### Mon Repos – Garden Lunches and Grand History in a Summer Villa\n\nIf you’re spending the day at Kadriorg Park, maybe with a visit to the Estonian Art Museum (KUMU), Mon Repos is a lovely, Michelin recognised restaurant on the edge of the park and just under a ten-minute walk from the sea.\n\nSet in a striking 19th-century villa, the building has lived many lives. Once a summer escape for Russian aristocrats, the manor was originally built by Carl Ferdinand Gahlnbäck in the 1850s, when the area was known as a popular holiday destination. Over the years, it was left empty for long stretches and later converted into flats during the Soviet era. Today, the villa has been beautifully restored, with its grand terraces, French windows, and leafy views nodding to its past.\n\nWe sat in the garden on a breezy afternoon, surrounded by trees and flowers, and it truly felt like we’d stepped out of the city entirely.\n\nWe had the burgers, which hit all the right notes for a summer lunch: fresh, juicy, and full of flavour. The mango chilli tiger prawns and calamari were also creative and full of flavour, bold, bright, and cooked just right.\n\nMon Repos is the kind of place that manages to feel special without trying too hard, a beautiful setting with a thoughtful menu, perfect for an easy afternoon in the park.\n\n### Rataskaevu 16 – A Restaurant with No Name but a Clear Soul\n\nAn institution in Tallinn’s Old Town, beloved by both locals and visitors eager to experience its remarkable dishes and local flavours with a modern twist, Rataskaevu 16 has earned its reputation as one of the city’s most cherished restaurants.\n\nThe restaurant is quite literally located at Rataskaevu 16, and the story behind its name says a lot about the spirit of the place. What started as a simple hunt for a name turned into something deeper: a shared sense of ease, creativity, and warmth that ended up shaping everything about the restaurant. Long before they settled on what to call it, the atmosphere had already taken root with good food, good company, and a setting that just felt right.\n\nA spot with over five thousand Google reviews in the city centre could easily lean into gimmicks. Rataskaevu 16 is anything but that. Housed in a beautifully renovated medieval building, the space is cosy and inviting, with soft lighting and genuinely friendly service that doesn’t feel forced.\n\nThe food was a highlight of our trip. We split a vegetarian and a meat dish, both carefully composed and full of flavour. The spinach orzotto was a hearty and comforting main, with portobello mushrooms, water chestnuts, marinated kohlrabi and parmesan. The breaded chicken fillet came perfectly plated with yellow tomato cream, romanesco, lentils, celery and leek. Colourful, satisfying and thoughtfully done.\n\nRataskaevu 16 completely lives up to the hype. It fills up quickly, so it’s worth booking ahead if you want to experience it for yourself.\n\n### R14 – Bold Mediterranean Flavours in Tallinn’s Rotermann Quarter\n\nR14 is located in one of the most eye-catching buildings in the Rotermann Quarter, a former power station from the nineteenth century that used to supply energy to the area’s industrial factories. These days, Rotermann has evolved into one of Tallinn’s most interesting corners, where old meets new through a mix of restored stone buildings and clean, modern architecture. It’s a lively part of the city to explore, full of design shops, cafés, and galleries, and R14 is a great place to pause mid-way through it all. Recognised by the Michelin Guide, the restaurant brings a mix of thoughtful food and an easygoing, elegant setting.\n\nThe menu is Mediterranean-focused and carefully put together, offering just the right number of dishes to feel confident in each one. The tiger prawns with spicy herb ghee were a clear standout, vibrant, clever, and balanced, with just the right amount of heat. The beef rigatoni in a creamy wine sauce was equally memorable. The pasta was cooked perfectly, the sauce was rich but not too heavy, balanced by the wine, and every bite felt well thought through.\n\nIf you’re in the Rotermann area, it’s a solid choice for a well-executed meal in a setting that mixes history with what feels like the future of the city.\n\nTallinn’s food scene exceeded all of my expectations, offering everything from traditional Estonian classics to inspiring, passionate takes on local, sustainable, and organic cuisine. With one visit, it’s clear to me that the Estonian capital is quickly becoming one of the most exciting up-and-coming food destinations of 2025.\n\nHave you checked out our [guide](https://www.urbanandbeyond.co.uk/blog/3-days-in-tallinn-estonia-from-medieval-streets-to-modern-innovation-2025-guide/) to visiting Tallinn?
