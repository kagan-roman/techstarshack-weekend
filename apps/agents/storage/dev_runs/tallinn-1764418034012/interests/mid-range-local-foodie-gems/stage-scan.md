Preliminary takeaways
- December is busy with holiday dinners; reservations recommended Thu–Sat. Natural wine bars (Veino, Time to Wine) fit the “attitude” and community vibe.

Hypotheses to validate next
- Which of these are open Mon–Wed and late-night kitchens post-gig; any seasonal menus.

Why some channels may be noisy
- Blogs can skew touristy; cross-check with Estonian-language reviews if time permits.
