Preliminary takeaways
- Within trip window, at least Tehnopol’s Foreign Founders Meetup (Dec 3) is a fit. Likely additional holiday socials (Founder2Founder).

Hypotheses to validate next
- Confirm exact time/registration links for Dec 3 event.
- Identify any pitch nights or demo days during Dec 1–14.
