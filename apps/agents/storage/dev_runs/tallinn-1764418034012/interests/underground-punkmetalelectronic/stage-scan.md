- Ticketing typically via Fienta/Piletilevi/Piletitasku; door cash possible for DIY nights.

Hypotheses to validate next
- Exact dates/times for shows in Dec 1–14 (e.g., MONO, Decapitated, Glitch Please 12.12 at Paavli).
- Smaller DIY spaces (Botik, Sveta legacy, Erinevate Tubade Klubi) programming during the window.

Why some channels may be quiet
