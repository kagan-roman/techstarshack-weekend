Other leads
- Paavli also shows SLAM! wrestling 12 Dec and multiple alt events; techno/warehouse options likely at HALL/Noblessner but require separate check on week-of announcements.

Assessment for trip window
- Strong fit for heavy/underground preference: MONO (post-rock heaviness) on 1 Dec and Glitch Please (electronic) on 12 Dec.
- Expect additional smaller DIY gigs to surface ~1–2 weeks prior via FB groups and venue IG.

Notes on limitations
- HALL often announces on RA/IG shortly before; Sveta legacy programming is sporadic; some events are private/Telegram-only.
