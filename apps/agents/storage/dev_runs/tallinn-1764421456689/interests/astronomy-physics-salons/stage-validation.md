VALIDATION – Tallinn Astronomy & Physics (Dec 1–14, 2025)

Findings
- No listed Tallinn-specific public astronomy nights in 1–14 Dec via national hub calendars. December has extremely short daylight (sun ~08:51–15:28 on Dec 1; source: timeanddate.com), which is great for early observing but weather can be overcast.
- Eesti Astronoomia Selts (Astronoomia.ee) calendar shows no Tallinn events in that window at time of check. Many clubs go quiet near exam season/holidays.
- Practical alternatives: coordinate a private visit at Tallinna Tähetorn (TalTech; by prior arrangement), or join Baltic Astronomy Club / Ridamus channels which may announce short-notice skywatches depending on weather.

Actionables for the trip window
- Geminid meteor shower peaks around Dec 13–14 UTC. If skies clear, do an urban-dark pocket lookout (Kalamaja seaside, Paljassaare, or Pirita beach) or short drive to Harku forest edge. Bring thermos, red light, and tripod.
