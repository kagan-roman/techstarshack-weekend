We love connecting people. We love likeminded people, who give their all in order to challenge the existing norms and never stop asking questions. We believe in synergy and co-growing. That’s the reason to make LIFT99 your second home.\n\nWe have seen several successful stories of startups who joined our community in early stage. They passionately developed their idea, got feedback from peer community members, learned from other founders’ experience, raised their first investment rounds, and built their team until it was time to fly out from our Hub to reach higher levels.\n\n[Learn more](/community) about Awesomic, Dashbird and Outfunnel’s stories.\n\n# Life at the Hubs\n\n[Margus Jõemaa (Finance Plus): Tackling Taxes Like a Puzzle - A Startup-Friendly Take on Tax Planning](/blog/finance-plus/taxes)\n\n[Another Game-Changer on the Wall: Stargate Hydrogen](/blog/stargate-hydrogen-wall-of-fame)\n\n[Small Beginnings, Big Dreams: The Journey of Spindl’s Founders](/blog/humans-of-lift99/spindl)\n\n[Bisly Joins the #EstoniaMafia Wall of Fame!](/blog/bisly-wall-of-fame)\n\n[Navigating Estonia’s Startup Landscape: Linda and Margus from Karma VC Reflect on 2024](/blog/navigating-estonias-investment-landscape-with-karma-vc)\n\n "
