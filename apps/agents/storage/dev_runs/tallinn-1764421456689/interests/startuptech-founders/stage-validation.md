VALIDATION – Tallinn Startup/Tech Founders (Dec 1–14, 2025)

Findings
- Tehnopol lists “Foreign Founders Meetup: How to find your first customers in Estonia” on Dec 3, 2025, 17:30–21:00 at WISE, Kopli 68a (Põhjala). Strong match for early-stage founders.
- Meetup shows Tallinn Startup Founder 101 group with primarily online/global content during Dec; local in-person founder nights are lighter near holidays.
- LIFT99 Tallinn Hub remains a good drop-in for community if you have membership/guest pass; events often posted on FB/IG.

Notes
- December is slower for pitch/demo nights; ad-hoc coffees still active in hubs (Lift99 Telliskivi, Tehnopol, Palo Alto Club).
