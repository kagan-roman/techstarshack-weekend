SCAN – Tallinn Underground punk/metal/electronic (Dec 2025 window)

What surfaced quickly
- Paavli Kultuurivabrik has a heavy December: MONO + Bedless Bones (Dec 1), Decapitated + Employed To Serve (Dec 4), drum & bass EATBRAIN night, darkwave bill “Beats from the Vault”, etc. Their program mixes punk/metal and leftfield electronics.
- Uus Laine carries eclectic live/DJ programming; Nov items are visible; expect Dec calendar to roll in late Nov. Worth checking FB/IG and Piletitasku.
- Resident Advisor lists Paavli VK as a venue for electronic calendars; Hall/Isola typical winter events likely but not visible in our pass.

Potential DIY/scene hubs
- Sveta Baar (Telliskivi) – typical for punk/hardcore and niche electronics (not captured in results, assume FB-first postings).
- Botik (Kopli), Kinomaja Keller, small basements pop up via FB events and Telegram.
