- Decapitated + Employed To Serve + Humanity — Dec 4 @ Paavli Kultuurivabrik. Sources: Paavli site; Spotify concerts aggregator.
- Vietnam Night – All You Can Eat — Dec 11 @ Paavli (food/community vibe on venue campus; pairs well with pre-game before darker shows). Source: AllEvents listing referencing Paavli 7.
- Additional Paavli bills in the period include darkwave “Beats from the Vault” and Glitch Please (electronic) around Dec 9–12 (titles present on venue list; exact times to confirm via Paavli site/FB).

Gaps / to watch
- Sveta Baar, Hall/Isola, and Uus Laine likely have shows; their own calendars or FB/IG may publish closer to date. Our limited budget did not deep-dive those.

Vibe fit
- Paavli leans underground-friendly despite some larger promoters; mixed crowd, reasonable door (varies by bill). Expect mosh at Decapitated and mood-gaze at MONO.
