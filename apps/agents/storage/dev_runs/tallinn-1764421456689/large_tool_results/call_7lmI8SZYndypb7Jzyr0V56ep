We’ve gathered all of them in a complete 2025 astronomy calendar. Plan your best stargazing nights with the [Sky Tonight](https://get.skytonight.app/cal2025_01) app that has an **astronomical calendar** showing exact dates and times for every celestial show and also provides an **interactive sky map** that helps easily find any space object in the sky. Find a cozy spot under the night sky and get ready to explore the wonders of the universe!\n\n## Contents\n\nConjunctions of celestial objects occur frequently. To keep this calendar convenient and avoid overwhelming you, we've included visible events where the objects are within rather close apparent distances:\n\n\\*Three middle fingers at arm’s length measure about 5°, a pinky finger measures about 1° to 1.5°.\n\nFor **meteor showers**, we included only major ones recognized by the [American Meteor Society](https://www.amsmeteors.org/meteor-showers/major-meteor-showers/), as they are generally the most well-known and active each year.\n\nThe events in the calendar are organized by date. Each event includes the time it occurs in **Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)** for reference. Keep in mind that the actual date of the event may vary by a day earlier or later, depending on your time zone.\n\nTo find the exact time an event is visible from your location, use the free astronomy app [**Sky Tonight**](https://get.skytonight.app/cal2025_03). Open the app’s calendar, tap the target icon next to the event you're interested in, and use the time slider at the top of the screen. This feature lets you track when celestial objects rise and set **in your specific location**.\n\n## Astronomical events in January 2025\n\nHere are some of the celestial events taking place in January 2025. For a detailed guide for this month, read our [dedicated article](/en/news/night-sky-tonight-january).\n\n### January 2-3: Quadrantid meteor shower peak\n\nThe first meteor shower of the year — the mighty Quadrantids — is a marvelous sight to see. Under suitable conditions, this meteor stream can provide dozens of shooting stars per hour. This year, **observing conditions are favorable** as the peak occurs during the waxing crescent Moon. Start looking for the Quadrantid meteors after midnight. You can continue your meteor hunt until January 12, as the Quadrantids are known to produce bright fireballs even after the peak.\n\n### January 3: Moon near Venus\n\nOn January 3, the 15%-illuminated Moon will be close to Venus (mag -4.5) in the sky. Observe them with the naked eye or through a pair of binoculars in the constellation Aquarius.\n\n### January 4: Moon near Saturn; lunar occultation of Saturn\n\nOn January 4, the 25%-illuminated Moon will be close to Saturn (mag 1.1) in the sky. Observe them with the naked eye or through a pair of binoculars in the constellation Aquarius. Also, a lunar occultation of Saturn will be visible over [Europe, Africa, western Russia, and eastern Greenland](https://eco.mtk.nao.ac.jp/cgi-bin/koyomi/occuly_p_en.cgi?eclid=202507).\n\n### January 5: Moon near Neptune; lunar occultation of Neptune\n\nOn January 5, the 35%-illuminated Moon will be close to Neptune (mag 7.9) in the sky.

Observe them with the naked eye or through a pair of binoculars in the constellation Taurus.\n\n### January 10: Venus at greatest elongation east\n\nOn January 10, Venus (mag -4.5) will appear at its farthest apparent distance east from the Sun: the celestial bodies will be separated by 47°12'. The event is called the [greatest elongation](/en/news/what-is-elongation). It’s the best time to observe Venus, so don’t miss the chance!\n\n### January 13: Full Moon\n\nThe [Full Wolf Moon](/en/news/full-moon-january) will occur on January 13 at 22:27 GMT. Our natural satellite will be in the constellation Gemini. Although the Full Moon technically lasts only a moment — when it is directly opposite the Sun relative to Earth — it appears fully illuminated a day before and after this time.\n\n### January 13: Comet C/2024 G3 (ATLAS) reaches its brightest\n\nIf we’re lucky, Comet C/2024 G3 might become visible to the **naked eye**, even in the daytime, by January 2025. However, it also might not survive perihelion and, even if it does, will be positioned quite close to the Sun in the sky. [Read our article](/en/news/comet-g3-atlas) to learn more about this comet.\n\n### January 14: Moon near Mars; lunar occultation of Mars\n\nOn January 14, the 99%-illuminated Moon will be close to Mars (mag -1.4) in the sky. Observe them with the naked eye or through a pair of binoculars in the constellation Gemini. Also, a lunar occultation of Mars will be observable from [North and South America and Africa](https://eco.mtk.nao.ac.jp/cgi-bin/koyomi/occuly_p_en.cgi?eclid=202503).\n\n### January 16: Mars at opposition\n\nMars will reach [opposition](/en/news/what-is-opposition-in-astronomy) on **January 16, 2025, at 01:17 GMT**. This is the best time to observe and photograph Mars, as it will be brighter than at any other time of the year and visible throughout the night.\n\nDuring the opposition, Mars will shine with a magnitude of -1.4 in the constellation Gemini. It will be easily visible to the naked eye. To explore the planet's surface, such as ice caps and brighter and darker areas, use a telescope of at least 50x magnification.\n\n### January 18: Saturn near Venus\n\nOn January 18, Saturn (mag 1.1) will be close to Venus (mag -4.6) in the sky.

Observe them with the naked eye or through a pair of binoculars in the constellation Scorpius.\n\n### January 29: New Moon\n\nThe New Moon will occur on January 29 at 12:36 GMT. At this point, our natural satellite will stay between the Earth and the Sun, so its bright side will be facing away from the Earth. It’s the best time for stargazing because the Moon’s light won’t hinder the view.\n\n## Astronomical events in February 2025\n\n### February 1: Neptune near Venus\n\nOn February 1, Neptune (mag 7.9) will be close to Venus (mag -4.6) in the sky. Observe Venus with the naked eye and use a pair of binoculars to see Neptune in the constellation Pisces.\n\n### February 1: Moon near Saturn; lunar occultation of Saturn\n\nOn February 1, the 9%-illuminated Moon will be close to Saturn (mag 1.1) in the sky.

At this point, our natural satellite will stay between the Earth and the Sun, so its bright side will be facing away from the Earth. It’s the best time for stargazing because the Moon’s light won’t hinder the view.\n\n### February 28: 7 planets in the planetary alignment\n\nSeven planets — **Saturn, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Uranus, and Neptune** — [will align](/en/news/what-is-planet-parade) in the evening sky. Five of these planets (Saturn, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Mars) will be visible to the naked eye.

Observe them through a pair of binoculars or a telescope in the constellation Pisces.\n\n### October 7: Full Moon, Supermoon\n\nThe [Full Harvest Moon](/en/news/full-moon-october) will occur on October 7 at 03:47 GMT. Our natural satellite will be in the constellation Pisces. Although the Full Moon technically lasts only a moment — when it is directly opposite the Sun relative to Earth — it appears fully illuminated a day before and after this time.\n\nThis Full Moon will be a [Supermoon](/en/infographics/supermoons-and-micromoons). It will be 6.6% bigger and 13% brighter than a regular Full Moon.\n\n![Supermoons & Micromoons](https://starwalk.space/gallery/images/supermoons-and-micromoons-prev/1140x599.jpg)\n\n### October 10: Moon near Pleiades\n\nOn October 10, the 88%-illuminated Moon will be close to the Pleiades star cluster (mag 1.2) in the sky. Observe them with the naked eye or through a pair of binoculars in the constellation Taurus.\n\n### October 13: Moon near Jupiter\n\nOn October 13, the 58%-illuminated Moon will be close to Jupiter (mag -2.2) in the sky. Observe them with the naked eye or through a pair of binoculars in the constellation Gemini.\n\n### October 19: Moon near Venus\n\nOn October 19, the 3%-illuminated Moon will be close to Venus (mag -3.9) in the sky. Observe them with the naked eye or through a pair of binoculars in the constellation Virgo.\n\n### October 19: Mercury near Mars\n\nOn October 19, Mercury (mag -0.2) will be close to Mars (mag 1.4) in the sky. Observe them with the naked eye or through a pair of binoculars in the constellation Libra.\n\n### October 20-21: Orionid meteor shower peak\n\nThe Orionids are a medium-strength meteor shower capable of showing occasional bursts of activity. For instance, [according to the American Meteor Society](https://www.amsmeteors.org/meteor-showers/meteor-shower-calendar/#Orionids), in 2006-2009, the Orionids’ peak rates nearly rivaled those of the Perseids, reaching 50-75 meteors per hour. This year, **observing conditions are ideal**, as the meteor shower peaks on the night of the New Moon. Watch for Orionid meteors starting from midnight until dawn.\n\n### October 21: New Moon\n\nThe New Moon will occur on October 21 at 12:25 GMT. At this point, our natural satellite will stay between the Earth and the Sun, so its bright side will be facing away from the Earth. It’s the best time for stargazing because the Moon’s light won’t hinder the view.\n\n### October 23: Moon near Mars\n\nOn October 23, the 4%-illuminated Moon will be close to Mars (mag 1.5) in the sky. Observe them with the naked eye or through a pair of binoculars in the constellation Libra.\n\n### October 23: Moon near Mercury\n\nOn October 23, the 4%-illuminated Moon will be close to Mercury (mag -0.2) in the sky. Observe them with the naked eye or through a pair of binoculars in the constellation Libra.\n\n### October 29: Mercury at greatest elongation east\n\nOn October 29, Mercury (mag -0.1) will appear at its farthest apparent distance east from the Sun: the celestial bodies will be separated by 23°54'. The event is called the [greatest elongation](/en/news/what-is-elongation). It’s the best time to observe Mercury, so don’t miss the chance!\n\n## Astronomical events in November 2025\n\n### November 2: Moon near Saturn\n\nOn November 2, the 86%-illuminated Moon will be close to Saturn (mag 0.8) in the sky. The Moon will be in the constellation Pisces and Saturn will be in the constellation Aquarius. Observe them with the naked eye or through a pair of binoculars.\n\n### November 2: Moon near Neptune\n\nOn November 2, the 88%-illuminated Moon will be close to Neptune (mag 7.8) in the sky. Observe them through a pair of binoculars or a telescope in the constellation Pisces.\n\n### November 4-5: Southern Taurid meteor shower peak\n\nThis meteor shower is one of the two branches of the large Taurids meteor stream. [The Southern Taurids reach their early maximum on October 9-10](/en/news/october-meteor-showers), and the main peak of their activity is on the night of November 4-5. Occasionally they produce very bright meteors. However, in 2025 their November peak falls on the Full Moon, so it's better to postpone observing for at least a few days until the moonlight is less intrusive.\n\n### November 5: Full Moon, the biggest Supermoon of 2025\n\nThe [Full Hunter’s Moon](/en/news/full-moon-november) will occur on November 5 at 13:19 GMT. Our natural satellite will be in the constellation Aries. Although the Full Moon technically lasts only a moment — when it is directly opposite the Sun relative to Earth — it appears fully illuminated a day before and after this time.\n\nThis Full Moon will be a [Supermoon](/en/infographics/supermoons-and-micromoons). It will also be the biggest and brightest Supermoon of the year (7.9% bigger and 16% brighter than a regular Full Moon).\n\n![Supermoons & Micromoons](https://starwalk.space/gallery/images/supermoons-and-micromoons-prev/1140x599.jpg)\n\n### November 6: Moon near Pleiades\n\nOn November 6, the 98%-illuminated Moon will be close to the Pleiades star cluster (mag 1.2) in the sky. Observe them with the naked eye or through a pair of binoculars in the constellation Taurus.\n\n### November 10: Moon near Jupiter\n\nOn November 10, the 70%-illuminated Moon will be close to Jupiter (mag -2.4) in the sky. Observe them with the naked eye or through a pair of binoculars in the constellation Gemini.\n\n### November 11-12: Northern Taurid meteor shower peak\n\nThe Northern Taurids are a part of the broad Taurid stream. It’s a quite weak meteor shower, producing up to 5 meteors per hour at maximum. However, it’s famous for producing many bright fireballs. In 2025, according to [IMO](https://www.imo.net/files/meteor-shower/cal2025.pdf), we can expect the enhanced rates of brighter Taurids a week around November 3. This falls on the period around the Full Moon, so the bright moonlight will hinder the observations.\n\n### November 17-18: Leonids meteor shower peak\n\nThe Leonids are most famous for producing spectacular meteor storms: for instance, in 1966, observers in the United States reported seeing 40 to 50 meteors **per second**, although much more often, we see the usual 10 meteors per hour. In 2025, the Leonids will peak three days before the New Moon, so **moonlight will present minimal interference**. The Leonids’ radiant rises around midnight and reaches the highest point in the sky at dawn.\n\n### November 20: New Moon\n\nThe New Moon will occur on November 20 at 06:47 GMT. At this point, our natural satellite will stay between the Earth and the Sun, so its bright side will be facing away from the Earth. It’s the best time for stargazing because the Moon’s light won’t hinder the view.\n\n### November 21: Uranus at opposition\n\nUranus will reach [opposition](/en/news/what-is-opposition-in-astronomy) on **November 21, 2025, at 12:17 GMT**. This is the best time to observe and photograph Uranus, as it will be brighter than at any other time of the year and visible throughout the night.\n\nDuring the opposition, Uranus will be at a magnitude of 5.6 in the constellation Taurus. However, even at this time, Uranus is too faint to be visible to the naked eye. Use a pair of binoculars or a telescope to see the planet.\n\n### November 29: Moon near Saturn\n\nOn November 29, the 66%-illuminated Moon will be close to Saturn (mag 0.9) in the sky. The Moon will be in the constellation Pisces, and Saturn will be in the constellation Aquarius. Observe them with the naked eye or through a pair of binoculars.\n\n### November 30: Moon near Neptune\n\nOn November 30, the 74%-illuminated Moon will be close to Neptune (mag 7.8) in the sky. Observe them through a pair of binoculars or a telescope in the constellation Pisces.\n\n## Astronomical events in December 2025\n\n### December 4: Moon near Pleiades\n\nOn December 4, the 98%-illuminated Moon will be close to the Pleiades star cluster (mag 1.2) in the sky. Observe them with the naked eye or through a pair of binoculars in the constellation Taurus.\n\n### December 4: Full Moon, Supermoon\n\nThe [Full Cold Moon](/en/news/full-moon-december) will occur on December 4 at 23:14 GMT. Our natural satellite will be in the constellation Taurus. Although the Full Moon technically lasts only a moment — when it is directly opposite the Sun relative to Earth — it appears fully illuminated a day before and after this time.\n\nThis Full Moon will be a [Supermoon](/en/infographics/supermoons-and-micromoons). It will be 7.9% bigger and 15% brighter than a regular Full Moon.\n\n![Supermoons & Micromoons](https://starwalk.space/gallery/images/supermoons-and-micromoons-prev/1140x599.jpg)\n\n### December 7: Mercury at greatest elongation west\n\nOn December 7, Mercury (mag -0.5) will appear at its farthest apparent distance west from the Sun: the celestial bodies will be separated by 20°42'. The event is called the [greatest elongation](/en/news/what-is-elongation). It’s the best time to observe Mercury, so don’t miss the chance!\n\n### December 7: Moon near Jupiter\n\nOn December 7, the 89%-illuminated Moon will be close to Jupiter (mag -2.6) in the sky. Observe them with the naked eye or through a pair of binoculars in the constellation Gemini.\n\n### December 13-14: Geminid meteor shower peak\n\nThe Geminids are one of the most spectacular meteor showers of the year. Their meteors are bright, plentiful, intensely colored, and slower moving. Luckily, in 2025, **viewing conditions are favorable** as the Moon is in the waning crescent phase. North of the equator, the Geminids’ radiant rises around sunset, so you can start observations already in the evening. In the Southern Hemisphere, the radiant appears in the sky around local midnight and culminates at about 2 a.m. local time.\n\n### December 20: New Moon\n\nThe New Moon will occur on December 20 at 01:43 GMT. At this point, our natural satellite will stay between the Earth and the Sun, so its bright side will be facing away from the Earth. It’s the best time for stargazing because the Moon’s light won’t hinder the view.\n\n### December 21: December solstice\n\nThe [December solstice](/en/news/what-is-a-solstice) marks the first day of astronomical winter in the Northern Hemisphere and the first day of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. In 2025, it will happen on December 21, at 15:03 GMT. It will be the shortest day in the Northern Hemisphere; the Southern Hemisphere, on the contrary, will experience the greatest amount of sunlight and the longest day of the year. We prepared a fun and educational [quiz about equinoxes and solstices](/en/quiz/equinox-solstice) for you. Check if you can tell the difference between these two astronomical events!\n\n![Equinoxes & solstices quiz intro#2](https://starwalk.space/gallery/images/equinox-solstice-quiz-intro-2/1920x1080.jpg)\n\n### December 22-23: Ursid meteor shower peak\n\nThe Ursids are a minor meteor shower that always peaks around the December solstice and produces 5-10 shooting stars per hour. This shower is often neglected because the mighty Geminids occur just a week before it. In 2025, you should definitely give the Ursids a chance, as they will occur just two days after the New Moon, so **the sky will be dark**. The Ursids’ radiant never sets below the horizon in northern locations, so you can observe the meteor shower all night.\n\n### December 27: Moon near Saturn\n\nOn December 27, the 31%-illuminated Moon will be close to Saturn (mag 1.0) in the sky. The Moon will be in the constellation Pisces and Saturn will be in the constellation Aquarius. Observe them with the naked eye or through a pair of binoculars.\n\n### December 27: Moon near Neptune\n\nOn December 27, the 34%-illuminated Moon will be close to Neptune (mag 7.8) in the sky. Observe them through a pair of binoculars or a telescope in the constellation Pisces.\n\n### December 31: Moon near Pleiades\n\nOn December 31, the 88%-illuminated Moon will be close to the Pleiades star cluster (mag 1.2) in the sky. Observe them with the naked eye or through a pair of binoculars in the constellation Taurus.\n\n## Used sources\n\nFor this article, we used the following sources:\n\n## Bottom line: All Astronomical Events 2025\n\nNow you know what astronomical events to expect in 2025.
