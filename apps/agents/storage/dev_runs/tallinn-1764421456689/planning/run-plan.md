Pass plan and budget allocation

Budget per interest (calls): astro 2, punk 2, startups 1, foodie 1.

- SCAN round (2 calls total, parallel):
  • astro scan (EN/ET/RU keywords across Tallinn orgs, map venues & calendars)
  • punk scan (EN/ET/RU keywords, map venues/collectives & ticketing)

- VALIDATION round (remaining 4 calls):
  • astro validation (dates within 12/01–12/14, fit & weather caveats)
  • punk validation (exact shows & door prices)
  • startups validation (quick pass for any founder meetups/hack nights)
  • foodie validation (hours, reservation friction, pop-up tastings)

No deep_dive phase unless scan results are too sparse; if so, convert a validation call to deep_dive and document tradeoff.

Outputs each pass to /interests/{slug}/stage-{stage}.md and maintain budget/budget.json.
