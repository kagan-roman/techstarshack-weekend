High-signal picks (see /reports/recommendations.json for structured list)

Astronomy & Physics
- No fixed public astronomy nights posted in Tallinn during Dec 1–14 via Astronoomia.ee. December is great for early night sky if clouds cooperate. Plan a Geminids mini-salon (Dec 13/14 peak): Paljassaare spit or Pirita beach are the closest darker pockets. Pack thermos + red light. Sources: Astronoomia.ee; Timeanddate sun graph.

Underground punk/metal/electronic
- Paavli Kultuurivabrik is the current magnet:
  • MONO + Bedless Bones – Dec 1, doors 19:00 (Live Nation, Songkick, venue page).  
  • Decapitated + Employed To Serve (+ Humanity) – Dec 4 (venue, Spotify concerts).  
  • Darkwave/EBM social “Beats from the Vault” and “Glitch Please” land around Dec 9–12 — confirm week-of on Paavli page.
- Keep an eye on Sveta Baar, Hall/Isola, Uus Laine for late-posted bills (FB/IG heavy). Details: /interests/underground-punkmetalelectronic/

Startup/tech founders
- Tehnopol: Foreign Founders Meetup (How to find first customers in Estonia) on Dec 3, 17:30–21:00 @ WISE, Kopli 68a. LIFT99 open to members/guests; Meetup groups tilt online near holidays. Details: /interests/startuptech-founders/stage-validation.md

Mid-range foodie gems
- Lore Bistroo (MICHELIN Bib) in Noblessner is on form (winter hours + menu live). Pair with Põhjala Tap Room brewery tour (DinnerBooking). Paavli campus does “Vietnam Night – All You Can Eat” on Dec 11 — low-key local crowd, easy to chain with shows. Details: /interests/mid-range-local-foodie-gems/stage-validation.md

Dry or gated channels (documented)
- Astronomy FB groups and university calendars quiet in December (exam/holiday slowdowns). Some underground venues publish late or via private Telegram; without deep-dive, we logged venue pages and RA stubs.

Quick nightly skeleton (mix-and-match)
- Dec 1 (Mon): Lore early bite in Noblessner → tram/bus to Paavli for MONO.  
- Dec 3 (Wed): Foreign Founders Meetup @ WISE (Kopli) → Botik/Paavli for a nightcap.  
- Dec 4 (Thu): Decapitated @ Paavli (arrive early for merch; earplugs).  
- Dec 11 (Thu): Vietnam Night canteen @ Paavli → darkwave/Glitch Please if scheduled.  
- Dec 13/14 (Sat/Sun): Geminids watch window (shoot for Paljassaare; windproof layers).

Local pro-tips
- Tallinn winter: sunset ~15:20; plan early dinners. Rideshare or bus for Paljassaare after dark; paths can glaze with ice.  
- For Paavli shows, cashless bars; cloakroom queue can bite — arrive 20–30 min before doors.  
- Lore: book if Fri/Sat; they do sharing menus and have Christmas packages; walk-in at bar can work on weeknights.
