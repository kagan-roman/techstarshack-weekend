Kai was founded in 2019 by the Estonian Contemporary Art Development Center (ECADC), a nonprofit contemporary art organization that supports contemporary Estonian art and helps to make it more internationally visible.\n\nThe Kai Art Center is located in a spacious two-story building that used to house a secret factory for the construction and repair of submarines.\n\nThe center invites both foreign and Estonian artists to exhibit their works. At the moment visitors can enjoy Tallinn-based video artist Holger Loodus’ “18 Moments of Spring” exhibition. Two meditative video installations are created especially for Kai’s unique space – walking through a wall of waterfalls gives the viewer both a spatial and calming experience.\n\nKai Art Center is also home to the only cinema in Northern Tallinn, operated by Sõprus Cinema, as well as an art book store run by independent publisher Lugemik.\n\nAfter viewing exhibitions or watching a movie, guests can have a bite on the first floor of the center, where several delicious restaurants are located.\n\nInformation about events and exhibitions is available at www.kai.center/en\n\nTo stay up to date with the news, follow Kai on social networks:  \n[www.facebook.com/ecadc](http://www.facebook.com/ecadc)  \n[www.instagram.com/kaicenter](http://www.instagram.com/kaicenter)\n\nPhotos of the exhibition: Anu Vahtra\n\n### Tallinn, Estonia\n\n![Object sidebar banner](https://visitbaltics.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/expedia_600x600_eng.jpg)\n![](https://visitbaltics.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/01-2.jpg)\n![](https://visitbaltics.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/01.jpg)\n![](https://visitbaltics.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/01-1.jpg)\n![Object footer banner](https://visitbaltics.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/visitbaltic_1600x400.jpg)\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=653559868491391&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n![](https://mc.yandex.ru/watch/55664263)"
