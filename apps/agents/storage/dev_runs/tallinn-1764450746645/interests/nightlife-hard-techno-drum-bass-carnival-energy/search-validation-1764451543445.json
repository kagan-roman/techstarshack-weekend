December at 19:00 - Saturday 6. December at 06:00\n\nTechno club HALL, Tallinn\n\ngateme.com\n\n### One night, two worlds – CU Showcase x kontrast.\n\nOn December 5th, Hall opens its doors for a mini-festival where live music, club culture, and boundless curiosity collide.\n\nCU Showcase begins the evening with a space where music isn’t just something to listen to – it’s an experience that pulls you in.  \nThis night weaves together experimental soundscapes, hypnotic rhythms, and the personal universes of each artist.  \nFor the first time in Estonia, two Italian visionaries take the stage:  \nNoklan, whose genre-bending sound blends rock, techno, ambient, and cinematic sensitivity and Rome in Reverse, whose club-driven, emotional, and atmospheric electronics have captivated audiences across Europe and Asia.  \nThey are joined by Kristjan Glück, bringing an authentically Estonian, intimate, and deeply human connection – a fusion of modern folk, nostalgia, and electronic elements.\n\nAt 23:00, Hall transforms into a night engine.  \nkontrast takes over three stages and pushes the energy to the limit – an eclectic, varied, and explosive program featuring more than 15 artists across the dancefloors.  \nOn stage are international and local heavyweights,  \nas well as the sounds of tomorrow – the kontrast debut stage, where several emerging Estonian artists perform publicly for the very first time.  \nThis is a night where avant-garde meets club culture; a night unbound by genre or space.  \nA full spectrum from immersive live sets to early-morning techno – a one-of-a-kind experience that happens only once.\n\n### TIMETABLE\n\n19:00 DOORS  \n20:30 Kristjan Glück  \n21:00 Noklan  \n22:00 Rome In Reverse\n\nVibrancy stage  \n23:00 Punch  \n00:00 Andreas Kask  \n02:00 Gusted  \n04:00 Katja Adrikova\n\nMonochrome stage  \n23:30 Motobor LIVE  \n00:30 Rästas  \n02:30 Merimell  \n04:30 Lego\n\nkontrast stage  \n23:30 LMV  \n00:30 JXNDER  \n01:30 QI'RA  \n02:30 Wash Electra  \n04:00 Sassbass\n\n### Lego (SE)\n\n### Gusted (Berlin)\n\n### Andreas Kask\n\n-Soundcloud: <https://soundcloud.com/kazk>\n\n### Merimell\n\n-Soundcloud: <https://soundcloud.com/merimell>  \n-Instagram: <https://www.instagram.com/merimell/>  \n-YouTube: <https://www.youtube.com/@Merimell>\n\n### Motobor LIVE\n\n-Soundcloud: <https://soundcloud.com/motobor>  \n-YouTube: <https://www.youtube.com/@motobormusic>\n\n### Punch\n\n-Instagram: <https://www.instagram.com/d.j.punch/>\n\n### Rästas\n\n-Soundcloud: <https://soundcloud.com/brettrastas>  \n-Instagram: <https://www.instagram.com/brettrastas/>\n\n### Katja Adrikova\n\n### SASSBASS\n\n### Wash Electra\n\n### JXNDER\n\n### QI'RA\n\n### LMV\n\n### ABOUT THE ARTISTS\n\n### Noklan (IT)\n\nNoklan is a musician and producer from Naples. His music is a surprising fusion of genres, blending elements of rock, alternative, house, techno, ambient, and synthwave to create a unique and captivating sound. His tracks are a journey through  \nsoundscapes, where immersive melodies and hypnotic, obsessive rhythms merge with imagery. One could describe it as \"music for travel.\"  \nIn addition to his solo career, which began in 2023 with the album A Large Space In A Small Room, mixed and mastered by Francesco Giuliano at Innerwood Music Mansion and released by PHONOTYPE RECORD, Noklan has collaborated with a number of other artists and producers, bringing projects to life such as Fragile, Vena, Static Wave Form, as well as working with Native Instruments in Berlin and writing and producing  \nsoundtracks for short films.\n\n### Rome in Reverse (IT)\n\nRome in Reverse, the solo project of Italian-born, Copenhagen-based artist Antonella Pacifico, has been a force in the electronic music scene since her debut in 2014. With a sound that fuses club dance music, trance-techno, ambient dub, and trip-hop, she creates an immersive sonic experience with emotive vocals and fluid up/downtempo beats. Her breakthrough came with the release of her first full-length album, Loop and Reverse  \n(2015), which garnered the attention of Luxembourg-based producer Victor Ferreira, aka Sun Glitters. This collaboration sparked two major releases in 2016—Northern Lights EP  \nand Sun in Reverse (split EP)—and led to a European tour with Arms & Sleepers and Sun Glitters, cementing her reputation on the international stage.  \n2018 saw the release of her second full-length album, The Prestige, and a standout per-formance at Aarhus Recession Festival, where her atmospheric sound captivated audiences. Growing up in southern Italy and Tuscany, with formative years spent in Rome, Pacifico is a self-taught musician who infuses her music with the richness of her cultural heritage. Beyond Eeurope, Pacifico has consistently toured across Asia, performing in Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam. She’s played in some of the top 50 clubs in the Asian region, where she has built a dedicated and passionate audience. Her performances are a blend of dynamic energy and visual art, turning every set into a full sensory experience.  \nHer recent single, \"Kajal\" featured on the US label future archive, continues to push her  \nsound forward and keeping her trajectory strong in shaping the future of electronic music.\n\n### Kristjan Glück (EE)\n\nKristjan Glück is a self-taught musician from Viljandi. His style is a blend of different genres, and with every new project, he likes to experiment and discover new ways to express himself through music and songwriting. He combines folk instruments and traditional elements with modern production. Taking influence from Estonian nostalgia, folklore and everyday discoveries, he crafts soundscapes and stories from diverse emotions and personal experiences. In his live performances, he emphasises the importance of human connection, the beauty of being unique and feeling free to move your body in the ways that it wants to move.\n\n### NB!
