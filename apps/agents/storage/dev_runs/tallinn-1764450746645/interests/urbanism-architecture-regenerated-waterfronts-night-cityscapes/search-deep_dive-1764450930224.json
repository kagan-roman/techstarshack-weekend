Ancient Greek did not have a /ʃ/ \"sh\" phoneme, so the derived Greek letter Sigma \"Sigma (letter)\") (Σ) came to represent the voiceless alveolar sibilant /s/. The original name of the letter \"Sigma\" may have been *san*, but due to the early history of the Greek epichoric alphabets, \"san\" came to be identified as a separate letter, Ϻ \"San (letter)\"). In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, ⟨s⟩ represents the voiceless alveolar or voiceless dental sibilant /s/. \"L2/17-013: Proposal to encode three uppercase Latin letters used in early Pinyin\" (PDF).",
