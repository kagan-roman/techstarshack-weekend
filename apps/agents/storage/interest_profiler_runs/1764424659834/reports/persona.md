Persona – demo-user

Summary
RU/EN-speaking traveler-gamer with a strong appetite for history, strategy/RPGs, and energetic music. Media diet mixes long-form history deconstructions (Клим Жуков), geopolitics commentary, and gaming meta for Baldur’s Gate 3 and Heroes of Might and Magic III. Instagram shows frequent travel to Atlantic islands (Madeira, Azores) and Eastern/Central Europe (Poland, Turkey, Portugal, Serbia), plus ties to US Northeast (NY/NJ, Princeton). Tone alternates between playful (travel captions) and reflective/ethical (WWII memory at Auschwitz).

Geographic anchors
- Eastern/Central Europe: Poland (Auschwitz-Birkenau; Muzeum Historii Polski), Zakopane/Tatras; Serbia (Kopaonik, Devojački Grob); Turkey (Istanbul); Portugal (Porto); Estonia (Noblessner, Tallinn – inferred by tag); Portugal Islands: Madeira (Fanal, Carnival), Azores (São Miguel, Caldeira Velha).
  Evidence (instagram.md, blob-1): L10–16, L18–29, L68–74, L130–137, L139–151, L33–47, L101–119, L121–129, L6–7.
- Americas: Aruba (Flamingo Beach), USA Northeast (Manhattan/Princeton note; Matawan, New Jersey).
  Evidence (instagram.md, blob-1): L82–88, L77–81, L91–97.

Spending patterns (inferred)
- Travel and experiences: multiple international trips and nature/hiking excursions (Madeira, Azores, Aruba, Istanbul, Porto, Poland, Serbia; US trip). 
  Evidence: instagram.md (blob-1) locations listed above.
- Entertainment/media: substantial time investment in YouTube long-form lectures, travel docs, gaming guides; gaming likely includes purchases/DLC but no direct purchase logs.
  Evidence: youtube.md (blob-3) numerous long videos across weeks; BG3/HoMM3 content.
- Nightlife/fitness possibilities: high-energy music (hard techno/tekk, drum & bass) suggests club/rave attendance or workout/drive playlists; not directly evidenced by transactions.
  Evidence: music.md (blob-2) multiple hard techno and DnB entries.

Enduring interests (high-level)
- Strategy/RPG gaming (BG3, HoMM3; meta, guides, tournaments).
- History and military/armor accuracy; cinema deconstruction; Ancient Egypt and Rus history.
- Travel/outdoors: hiking, scenic viewpoints, island landscapes; urbanism and safety in cities via travel journalism.
- Energetic music: hard techno/tekk, drum & bass; Russian/CIS rap; 2000s rock nostalgia; Eurodance/pop classics.

Tone and values
- Playful/romantic about travel: “Carnival in Madeira... Lots of beautiful girls...” (instagram.md, blob-1, L56–57); curious and humorous captions (e.g., "Witchcraft place indeed").
- Reflective and morally anchored on historical atrocities: detailed Auschwitz caption about not forgetting and avoiding trivialization (instagram.md, blob-1, L23–29).

Blind spots / caveats
- No financial records; spending is inferred from travel frequency and media/gaming engagement.
- Recency: Instagram uses relative weeks (e.g., 26w, 93w); YouTube is date-stamped by platform text, but absolute calendar alignment to user’s timeline is partial; music list lacks timestamps.
- Home base is uncertain: RU-speaking content predominates; appears to have visited/possibly lived in NY/NJ area but we cannot assert residency.
