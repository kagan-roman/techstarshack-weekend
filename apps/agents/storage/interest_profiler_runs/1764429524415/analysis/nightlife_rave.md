Durable travel mapping:
- Likely to seek underground techno nights, warehouse raves, bass-heavy club rooms, and hybrid hip‑hop/club events; enjoys carnival/street parade energy but not brand‑loyal.

Formats likely enjoyed:
- Night clubs with hard techno/industrial rooms, DnB events, underground venues, street festivals; late-night sets.
