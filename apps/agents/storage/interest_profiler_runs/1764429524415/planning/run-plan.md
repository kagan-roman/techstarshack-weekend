Inputs scanned:

Quick stats:
- Languages: predominantly Russian with some English
- Domains: travel posts (islands, mountains, cities), museums & dark history, nature hikes, beaches; heavy music signals (hard techno, rap, nu metal, darkwave, Eurodance); YouTube: history deconstructions (armor, Egypt), geopolitics/current events, travel/urbanism channels (Varlamov), gaming (Baldur’s Gate 3, Heroes III)
- Regions appearing: Portugal (Madeira, Porto, Azores), Poland (Auschwitz, Zakopane), Turkey (Istanbul), Aruba (Renaissance Island), USA (NY/NJ), Serbia (Kopaonik/Devojački Grob), Estonia (Noblessner – to verify)
- Activity styles: hiking/volcanic/nature, museums & historical reflection, urban night photography, beach/tropics, carnival/festival curiosity, underground club energy

Ambiguities to verify (entity_lookup budget 8):
- “Noblessner” likely Tallinn seafront cultural quarter (Estonia) – verify
- “Devojački Grob” hike/peak near Kopaonik (Serbia) – verify

Open questions / blind spots to track:
- Home base unknown (possible NJ/NY glimpses); do not assume
- Budget not explicit; multiple international trips suggest mid–premium, but confidence limited
- No explicit food/restaurant signals
- Recency: Instagram shows relative timestamps (e.g., 26w, 35w) without capture date; YouTube appears current but skewed to politics/history; treat as taste not itinerary

Next steps:
1) Extract evidence snippets per theme (nature/hiking; dark history & museums; urbanism/architecture; nightlife/rave; gaming→medieval/armor; warm beaches/tropics; post‑Soviet/Baltic scenes)
2) Draft analysis notes under /analysis/<theme>.md with mapping to durable, reusable travel interests
3) Assemble persona.md narrative with spending pattern inference and travel lens
4) Produce profile.json matching schema exactly; validate and note blind spots
