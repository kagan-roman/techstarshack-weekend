Run plan – 1bdfa38f-7e08-466d-aab1-d13e29f25c2f

Quick stats
- Inputs: instagram.md (3.4 KB), music.md (~14 KB), youtube.md (~86 KB)
- Languages: mostly Russian; some English/Portuguese track titles
- Recency window in IG: posts up to ~26–94w ago; strong travel history (Madeira, Azores, Istanbul, Aruba, NYC/NJ, Poland, Serbia)
- YouTube: heavy watch history in history analysis (Klim Zhukov, Kino-Teatr), geopolitics commentary (Shary), travel journalism (Varlamov Travel, Harry Jaggard), gaming (Baldur’s Gate 3, Heroes of Might & Magic III), science/anthropology (Drobyshevsky). Also Egypt resort tips and Africa city reports.
- Music: eclectic mix — Russian rap/trap (Scriptonite, Oxxxymiron, Miyagi), hard techno/industrial (Drumcode, KI/KI, Raganzini/Ferrara, Schrotthagen), 2000s nu-metal/alt-metal (Korn, Deftones, SOAD), DnB/trance, 80s Eurodance/Italo (C.C. Catch, Laura Branigan), Slavic folk-rave (Нейромонах Феофан), darkwave/synth (Mr.Kitty, Crystal Castles), regional rap (Ulukmanapo, Gio Pika), Brazilian funk (Dennis/Anitta), ADF ‘Fortress Europe’ (NFS Underground nostalgia).

Initial hypotheses
- Travel lens: curious, historically minded (WWII sites like Auschwitz, Polish history film deconstructions), enjoys rugged landscapes and moody nature (Madeira Fanal cloud forest, Azores hot springs, hiking). Interested in festivals/carnival vibes. Comfortable in urban exploration (Istanbul cats, Porto nights, Manhattan/Princeton architecture vibes).
- Nightlife/party energy: enjoys hard techno/industrial and remixed 90s/00s — suggests underground club interest; also DnB/trance scenes.
- Gaming fandom: strong nostalgia (HoMM3) + modern CRPG (BG3). Could map to liking medieval castles, armory museums, strategy/war history tours.
- Budget: mixed signals. Watches Egypt “best value hotels,” but also international trips (Aruba, Azores, Madeira). Likely mid with selective splurges.

Questions / ambiguities to resolve
- ‘Noblessner’ and ‘Muzeum Historii Polski’ on IG: likely Tallinn seafront district and Warsaw museum; confirm if needed for regional affinity (Baltics, Poland)
- Are there consistent food cues? Very sparse; need to infer via music (Brazil funk, Italo/Eurodance) and travel videos (Egypt resort tips, Bangkok guides).
- Social energy: enjoys crowds (carnival) but also solemn sites (Auschwitz). Mixed intro/extro; leaning flexible.
- Timeframe bias: YouTube is very recent; Instagram older. Region gaps: Asia beyond Turkey/Thailand (consumption) and Japan videos; Americas (NY/NJ/Aruba) but no Latin travel besides Aruba.

Next steps
1) Thematic clustering with evidence snippets per theme.
2) Abstract hyper-specifics (BG3, HoMM3) into durable categories (medieval/strategy aesthetics, interactive museums, castle sieges reenactments).
3) Draft persona + JSON profile with macro scores and traits; call entity_lookup sparingly for ambiguous place names (<=8).
